Use simple semantic rules to compound css styles. For example: <div class="pad_5_horizontal"> will
add a 5 pixel horizontal padding to the div. Teh semantic rules follows a what, how much, where flow.
What = Padding
How Much = 5 Pixels
Where = Horizontal bounds.

A compound denominator (i.e. null) can remove that attribute. For example class="pad_null" will reset
the div's padding to 0.
